# Chipotle-Cluster-Analysis

In this notebook, we're going to have some fun exploring customer data from a 2016 survey of Chipotle customers in a particular city. Using k-means clustering, we'll discover unique customer groups based on their survey responses. Then, we'll come up with cool marketing ideas to help Chipotle connect with their customers even better and keep them coming back for more delicious burritos and bowls!

The survey used in this analysis can be found [here.](https://github.com/kyleplhm/Chipotle-Cluster-Analysis/blob/main/Chipotle%20Questionnaire%20and%20Data%20Key.pdf)
